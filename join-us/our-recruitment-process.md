## Our vision

When it comes to recruitment, regardless of the role, we are always looking for the following traits:

* Ownership mentality. People always work in small agile teams (3-5 people) and as a consequence, everyone has a great impact 
but also responsibility for the product the team is building. We go beyond execution, we want to our teammates to feel deeply 
involved in what they do. 
* Dependable. We go to great lengths for our clients, they can rely on us to deliver and all our team members are reliable 
and trustworthy.
* Continuous learner. Software development, UX/UI and product management keep evolving, hence our team members need to 
be ready to keep learning while on and off of the job. Our teammates are deeply passionate about what we do.  
* Courage. We must have the courage to speak up, raise our concerns in a timely manner and be able to confront the status 
quo with ideas by being constructive and without holding on to hard feelings.
* Flexible. As we work with many innovative companies from all over the work, the product strategy keeps evolving as we
go through the development. Thanks to our internal processes, we are able to provide flexibility to our clients while still
maintaining a high level of quality. But one needs to accept that change is the only constant. 
* Resilience. We must not give up easily when we face challenges, either interpersonal or professional.

## Applying to join us

We keep our process short and straightforward focusing on actionable and measurable metrics related to the type of work 
we do. Every candidate will go trough the followings stages:

### 1st Interview

Upon an initial screening over emails, we invite short-listed applicants for an interview. It can either be in in-person 
at our office for applicants living in the same country where our office is, or over Skype.

Interview slots are booked via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) so that applicants can pick a time that works best for them. 
Interviews usually take anywhere between 30 to 60 minutes.

During this first meet, we blend informal, technical and personality-based questions. At this first stage, we are checking 
both team-fit and technical aptitude. The technical questions do not require any special preparation as we do not do whiteboard 
interviews. Instead, we focus on practical and intermediate-level questions allowing applicants to reference their own experience 
and at the same time allowing us to verify if the applicant is up-to-date with the current technologies and best practices.  

### Code Assignment

Upon passing the first interview, applicants need to work on a code assignment relative to the positions they applied to 
i.e. Android test for Android developers, Ruby or JavaScript test for web developers, etc. We have tests for a large variety 
of stacks ðŸ¤“ 

Applicants are given one week to complete the assignment from the comfort of their home. Commitment-wise, each applicant 
should allocate between 4-8 hours of depending on their own technical aptitude and workflows. 

All code must be submitted via a public git-based code versioning platform such as Github, Bitbucket Gitlab. Upon submitting 
the link to the code repository, applicants need to make sure that the issue tracker is enabled on the repository so that our team can submit our code review 
feedback. 

Upon reception of the submission, our team usually take anywhere between 1-3 days to do a complete code reviews. As mentioned 
previously, we open issues to provide our feedback that can boil down to the following: 

* Questions on the implementation details. Often raised when we need clarifications on a technical decision taken by the 
applicant e.g. design pattern, non-standard (or not know to us) third party library. The purpose is for applicants to 
explain the reasons for their decision. 
* Recommendation to change the implementations. We ahre our best practices and recommend another way to implement the same 
feature.
* Bugs. Upon testing the small application, our team encountered a technical issue or a feature does not work as expected.

### 2nd Interview

This is very similar to the first interview but with different people from our team. 

At every stage, we involve our teammates so that they get to meet their potential future colleagues and inversely 
applicants get to meet several people from the team instead of only one person. 

Following the last interview, we will do a complete review of the applicant taking into all pieces information gathered 
during the whole application process. We are usually fast on taking a final decision. So applicants can expect a response,
whether positive or negative, within 1-2 days at most.

In our hiring process, we prefer to be too cautious. We rather reject someone by mistake than hire someone by mistake, since 
a wrong hire is much more disruptive. Organizations can reject [people with great potential](http://thehustle.co/whatsapp-founder-got-rejected-by-both-twitter-and-facebook-before-19-billion-buyout) 
so applicants who have not been selected should not be discouraged from seeking a great job.
