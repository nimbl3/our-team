We take a collaborative and product development approach, creating custom software that people will love to use and solving 
our clients' problems so that they can focus on what they do best - better.

If you want to grow together, work on challenging products and enjoy using the best tools and practices, Nimble is the

## What you will do

* You will have the leading position of the development team (2-3 developers) in a project squad working with a Product Owner and UX/UI Designer. 
* Decide which technologies are going to be used and define the overall architecture.
* Work closely with the Product Owner to make sure the backlog is efficiently planned and occasionally assist in technical discussions with clients. Most of the client interfacing is done by the Product Owner.
* Write clean, composable, and maintainable code as you develop word-class products for our clients.
* Write automated tests to build and maintain the product we build for our clients.
* Do code reviews with your squad members.
* Learn new technologies, languages, and techniques so that you are able to adapt to the evolving needs of our clients.

* Continuous learning with a yearly education allowance, monthly investment-time sessions, and access to subscription-based online services (Pluralsight, PragPub, LeanPub...).
* Provident Fund which allows you to save money every month and we match your monthly contributions ([see more detailed info](http://www.thaipvd.com/content_en.php?content_id=00307)).
