**Communication**

* We have worked with in-house and remote teams, and we have reached to the conclusion that our iterations are way faster when we are at the same office. It's also nice to talk about issues openly with your colleagues face to face, Skype calls with multiple people can be chaotic and non-productive.
* Slack. All the repositories and deployment activities are notified to specific rooms allowing us to track who is doing what. We believe in transparency so our clients and us are on the same page anytime.

**For deployment**

* Mina for deployments
* Digital Ocean/AWS/Heroku(sometimes) mainly as the projects we have done required low level adjustement. Heroku is not always a possibility.
* Some githooks for specific tasks like updating i18n files.
* Semaphore CI

* Sentry
* Icinga
* Munin
